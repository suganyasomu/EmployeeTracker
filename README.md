=======

## Description

This is about the  Employee Tracker, the user should be  able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company. This is an command line interface app which is created using node.js and mysql.

## Process

I started out by installing all the necessary npm libraries and by connecting to  mysql.
Created the basic prompts through which the user will be able insert, update and delete employees, roles and departments and will be able to view the budget based on the department. Created the sql's using several joins and used order by clause in sql.
